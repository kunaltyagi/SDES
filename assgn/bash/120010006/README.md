# Details
2 bash files (pardon any and all spelling/grammatical errors :) :
* 120010006.sh
* ceed_partsAB_checker.sh
These are not shell files, but bash files. Do not run using sh, use
bash instead.

# Executing the assignment
Simply use
```bash
$ ./ceed_partsAB_checker.sh
```
This will move the 120010006.sh to a new directory, run
that, create output from that as per exercise 1, and then create
output for exercise 2.

# Testing Exercise alone
## Exercise 1
To run only the first exercise, use the following command
```bash
$ ./120010006.sh
```
## Exercise 2
Follow instructions in previous section.

# Testing
If you want to run the scripts again and again, touch a file
```testing``` in order to allow ```ceed_partsAB_checker.sh``` to be
run successfully again.
